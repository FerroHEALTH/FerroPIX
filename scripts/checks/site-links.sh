# The site link guard: every internal link and anchor of the published site
# resolves (no specification governs this: our own design). It lints the
# book's sources with mdbook-lint (.mdbook-lint.toml), assembles the site the
# way the Docs workflow does (scripts/site/assemble.sh, the landing page at
# the root and the book under /docs/) into a temporary directory, with the
# roadmap block left empty so nothing is read from the network, and runs
# lychee offline over every page with --include-fragments, so a link to a
# page that does not exist and a link to an anchor a page does not carry both
# fail. It then checks README.md the same way, against the repository tree
# GitHub renders it in. --offline skips every http(s) link: the guard sends
# no request anywhere.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/checks/site-links.sh              assemble the site and check it
#   scripts/checks/site-links.sh --self-test  prove a broken anchor and a
#                                             missing page fail, a sound
#                                             page passes, and a missing
#                                             tool skips outside CI
# Needs mdbook, mdbook-lint and lychee (the documentation toolchain of
# docs/VERSIONS.md) on PATH. Outside CI (CI unset), a missing one prints a
# SKIP naming it and exits 0; in CI, which installs them all, it fails naming
# it. Exit 1 when a lint, a link or an anchor fails; 0 otherwise.
